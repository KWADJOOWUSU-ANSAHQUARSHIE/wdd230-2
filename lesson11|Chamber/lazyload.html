            <p>
                The Call of Duty: Black Ops series began in 2010, with the franchise releasing 5 main games and boasting
                over 100 years of in-game lore. From Vietnam to Rebirth Island and everything in between, dozens of
                locations are explored as the series covers real-world events like the Bay of Pigs Invasion and
                Operation Desert Storm. With the story beginning in the 1960s and reaching the far-flung future of 2065,
                players have faced off with both human soldiers and deadly robots alike.

            <h2>Down</h2>
            <p>
                With Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War‚Äôs campaign, Raven Software took players back to the 1980s,
                exploring a part of the Cold War that had previously gone untouched in the series. Adding yet another
                major chunk of storytelling to the lengthy Call of Duty: Black Ops timeline, the 2020 release makes a
                new story summary worthwhile. Players should buckle up for a wild ride, however, as there are major
                twists to see in every single Black Ops game.

            <h2>Front</h2>
            <p>
                The first game in the series and storyline, the original Call of Duty: Black Ops, places gamers in the
                shoes of Alex Mason. Born in Alaska and raised to put his survival skills to good use, the character's
                survivalist background is shown throughout the game. Call of Duty: Black Ops begins with Mason strapped
                to a chair and interrogating by CIA member Jason Hudson, with Mason seeming just as confused as the
                player likely is.

            <h2>Side</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout the course of the game, players learn that Alex Mason was brainwashed by Nikita Dragovich, a
                Russian terrorist using sleeper agents to spread a deadly gas across America. Dragovich also tasked Alex
                Mason with killing President JFK, though it remains unclear if he ever carried out the assassination.
                Regardless, someone tampered with the initial brainwashing process, as Call of Duty: World at War
                character Viktor Reznov further reprogrammed Mason‚Äôs brain after it had already been rewired.

            <h2>Base</h2>
            <p>
                With Reznov‚Äôs best friend being poisoned by Dragovich and Nova 6, a series of names was given to Mason.
                As Mason progresses through the list, he believes it is Reznov killing each target and carrying out his
                revenge. In reality, it is Mason himself doing the killing, with the game‚Äôs big twist revealing that
                Reznov had died earlier on in the game‚Äôs Vorkuta level. After discovering Alex Mason‚Äôs brainwashing,
                Hudson and the tortured protagonist stop Dragovich before he can carry out his war crimes.
