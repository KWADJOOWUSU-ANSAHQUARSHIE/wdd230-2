                    possibilities. Money, Planning, Inspiration, and Guidance, depends on the members
                    working vigorously on the committees of their choice. Careful study is made of the community needs

                    the economic welfare of the community. The Chamber works for industrial and business
                    development, which supports new residents with their revenues for our community. It
                    provides educational opportunities and assists businesses with the latest marketing and
