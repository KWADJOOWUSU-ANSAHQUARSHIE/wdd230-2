            As the representative organ of the business community and the voice of the organised private sector in
            Ghana, the Chamber maintains regular consultations with government on policies and measures affecting

        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <P>
            A chamber of commerce is an association or network of businesspeople designed to promote and protect the
            interests of its members. A chamber of commerce is often made up of a group of business owners that share a
            locale or interests, but can also be international in scope. Among the benefits chamber members receive are
            deals and discounts from other chamber members, listing in a member directory, and a variety of other
            programs and services designed to promote business activity in a region.
